          <p>
            This was a 12-week internship in the New York office, on the 
            Docs Engineering Productivity team. I was working on 
            JsTestDriver, a framework for running unit and
            integration tests on JavaScript applications. JsTestDriver
            is being used by the Docs and Analytics teams, among others.
            It's also being used outside of Google.
          </p>

          <p>
            I added functionality to allow clients to
            embed the test runner in the browser along with the
            system under test. The existing method instead started a 
            separate server, and ran the test runner on the
            server. I designed and implemented a menu user
            interface, and reworked the test runner so it could be
            compiled by the Google Closure Compiler along with the
            rest of the system under test.
          </p>

          <p>
            My contributions to JsTestDriver allowed it to provide an 
            alternative workflow with a faster feedback loop in scenarios 
            where cross-browser compatibility does not need to be verified.
            (e.g. calls to libraries like jQuery which handle browser
            differences internally)

          <p>
            IsisWorld is an open-source 3D simulator designed
            for research in commonsense AI systems. It puts actors into a 
            kitchen environment, where they are given the goal of 
            accomplishing tasks like making toast. The challenge is in 
            training them to perform these tasks without
            overspecializationoverspecialization or scripting. My job 
            involved fine-tuning the simulation environment and the 
            scenarios, and giving the system a layer of polish before 
            we advertise it more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also developed a related tool that allows
            users to tweak and optimize 3D models in the .egg file
            format (used by the Panda3D library). This is being used to 
            prepare models for IsisWorld, but it also has utility for 
            other projects that use 3D graphics with .egg files.
          </p>

          <p>
            I developed a constraint evaluation algorithm as part of a
            project related to Infosys's ftGEN software which
            automatically generates test data for software systems.
            It reads a predicate defined in a constraint-specification 
            language and decides how to satisfy it. My
            code sped up the software by more than an order of
            magnitude for a class of inputs that could be
            solved via boundary value analysis and equivalence
            partitioning.  Without my contribution, all inputs
            had to be processed by a genetic algorithm which could solve
            any possible input, but was significantly slower.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project used Java and Eclipse. It involved
            both software engineering and computer language engineering,
            as I had input in the design of the constraint
            specification language.

            I started the design for a data logger for the iPhone to track

            track usage of the MIT wi-fi network in various buildings on 
            campus.  This script pulled information off of the

            I developed algorithms to analyze problems in
            classical cryptology under the mentorship of
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/">
              Dr. William Gasarch
            </a>, a professor of Computer Science at the
            University of Maryland. These algorithms attempted
            known-ciphertext attacks on texts enciphered through
            various means, including random polyalphabetic ciphers and
            polygraphic ciphers with large enciphering matrices.
            This project culminated in the development of a suite
            of programs that analyzed various ciphers and a presentation
            of my findings related to the feasibility of
            applying modern computing methods to classical ciphers.
            The code can be found in the following
