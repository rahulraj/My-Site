      <section><h3> IsisWorld UROP (September 2010 - Present)</h3>
       <p>IsisWorld is an open-source 3D simulator designed for research into commonsense AI
       programs. It puts actors into a kitchen environment, where they are given the goal
       of accomplishing tasks like making toast. The challenge is in getting AIs to perform
       these tasks without overspecialization or scripting. My job involves fine-tuning
       the simulation environment and the scenarios, and overall giving the system a layer of
       polish before we start to advertise it more to the community.</p>
       
       <p>Currently, I am working on a related tool that allows
       users to tweak and optimize 3D models in the .egg file
       format. This is being used to prepare models for
       IsisWorld, but it also has utility for other projects that
       use 3D graphics with .egg files.</p>

       <p>A more detailed summary of IsisWorld can be found 
       <a href=http://mmp.mit.edu/isisworld/>here</a> and the code for the simulator is hosted
       in this <a href=https://github.com/dasmith/IsisWorld>Git
       repository</a></p>

      <section><h3> Infosys Internship (June 2010 - August 2010) </h3>
       <p>Developed a constraint evaluation algorithm as part of a
       project related to Infosys's ftGEN software which
       automatically generates test data for software.
       It reads an inputted predicate defined in a constraint-specification language
       and makes decisions as to how to generate data to satisfy
       the predicate.</p>
       <p>This project uses Java and Eclipse as the main technologies.
       It involves both software development processes and computer 
       language engineering as I was also involved in the design of the constraint
       specification language.</p>
       <p>For more information about my employer, see the
       <a href="http://www.infosys.com/pages/index.aspx">Infosys
       website.</a></p>

      <section><h3> UROP Researcher in Senseable Lab (February 2010 - June 2010) </h3>
       <p>Worked on a data logger for the iPhone to track people's transportation methods. 
       Also developed a script to track usage of the MIT wi-fi network in various buildings on campus.
       This script pulled information off of the 
       <a href="https://mrtg.mit.edu/mrtg/">MITnet Router Statistics website</a>
       related to the traffic of buildings of various types, and wrote the data to a MySQL database.
       (Note: MIT web certificates are needed to access the
       router statistics website)</p>

      <section><h3> Intern at University of Maryland (May 2008 - May 2009) </h3>
       <p>Developed algorithms to analyze problems in classical cryptology under the mentorship
       of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/">Dr. William Gasarch</a>, a professor of 
       Computer Science at the University of Maryland. These algorithms attempted
       ciphertext-only attacks on texts enciphered through various means, including random polyalphabetic 
       ciphers and polygraphic ciphers with large enciphering matrices. This project culminated
       in the development of a suite of programs that analyzed various ciphers and a presentation
       of my findings related to the question of the feasibility of applying modern computing
       methods to classical ciphers.</p>
