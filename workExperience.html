              <h3 id="first-section-title">Facebook Internship</h3>
              <p>
                This was a 12&ndash;week internship at Facebook's headquarters
                in Menlo Park, California. I was on the Facebook Chat team,
                working on a redesign of the Messages user interface. The new
                interface made heavy use of JavaScript and
                <span class="acronym">ajax</span> to avoid full page reloads,
                improving responsiveness. It displayed the page in a
                two&ndash;column layout which allowed users to see their inbox
                and specific conversations simultaneously.
              </p>

              <p>
                My most significant contributions were in the search feature.
                The original Messages interface reloaded the page on every
                search, hampering user experience. I updated the frontend to
                search the conversations available locally while waiting for
                the server to respond with a full set of results, providing
                instant feedback to queries.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also contributed to several other features, including
                highlighting results in full&ndash;text searches to indicate
                relation to the query, resolving compatibility issues with
                legacy browsers, implementing an interface to move between
                full&ndash;text search results, and displaying useful messages to the
                user in unusual scenarios.
              </p>

              <p>
                The new interface was launched to Facebook employees
                near the start of the summer, and began rolling out to the
                public on <time datetime="2012-08-22">August 22nd, 2012</time>.

              <h3>Software Design Group UROP</h3>
              <p>
                I did this <span class="acronym">urop</span> project under the
                supervision of Prof. Daniel Jackson at
                <span class="acronym">mit</span>. I was involved in Rubicon, a
                library used for static verification of Rails web apps. Rubicon
                uses Ruby's flexibility as a programming language to change the
                execution model of client code to build a model to analyze.
              </p>

              <p>
                Rubicon's attempts to redefine parts of the language were
                stymied by the existence of built-in keywords like
                &ldquo;if&rdquo;, &ldquo;and&rdquo;, and &ldquo;or&rdquo;;
                these could not be redefined like method calls. I designed and
                implemented code to make keyword redefinition possible by
                walking the abstract syntax tree and rewriting expressions,
                with the help of libraries including ParseTree, ruby_parser,
                and sexp_processor.
              </p>

              <p>
                My project was modular enough to be extracted out into its
                own library: virtual_keywords, available at
                <a href="http://github.com/rahulraj/virtual_keywords">
                  this Github repository.
                </a>
                virtual_keywords allows developers to redefine the behavior of
                Ruby code that uses built&ndash;in keywords. It does not expect
                developers to understand the intricate details of Ruby's
                grammar.

              <h3>Google Internship</h3>
              <p>
                I was on the Docs Engineering Productivity team, working on 
                JsTestDriver, a framework for running unit and
                integration tests on JavaScript applications. JsTestDriver
                is being used by the Docs and Analytics teams, among others.
                It's also being used outside of Google.
              </p>

              <p>
                I added functionality to allow clients to
                embed the test runner in the browser along with the
                system under test. The existing method instead started a 
                separate server, and ran the test runner on the
                server. I designed and implemented a menu user
                interface, and reworked the test runner so it could be
                compiled by the Google Closure Compiler along with the
                rest of the system under test.
              </p>

              <p>
                My contributions to JsTestDriver allowed it to provide an 
                alternate workflow with a faster feedback loop in scenarios 
                where cross-browser compatibility does not need to be verified.
                (e.g. calls to libraries like jQuery which handle browser
                differences internally)

              <h3>IsisWorld UROP</h3>
              <p>
                IsisWorld is an open-source 3D simulator designed
                for research in commonsense <span class="acronym">ai</span> systems. It puts actors into a 
                kitchen environment, where they are given the goal of 
                accomplishing tasks like making toast. The challenge is in 
                training them to perform these tasks without
                overspecialization or scripting. My job 
                involved fine-tuning the simulation environment and the 
                scenarios, and giving the system a layer of polish before 
                we advertise it more.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also developed a related tool that allows
                users to tweak and optimize 3D models in the .egg file
                format (used by the Panda3D library). This is being used to 
                prepare models for IsisWorld, but it also has utility for 
                other projects that use 3D graphics with .egg files.
              </p>

              <p>

              <h3>Infosys Internship</h3>
              <p>
                I developed a constraint evaluation algorithm as part of
                Infosys' ft<span class="acronym">gen</span>
                software which automatically generates test data for software
                systems.  It reads a predicate defined in a
                constraint&ndash;specification language and decides how to satisfy
                the predicate. My code sped up the software by more than an order of
                magnitude for a class of inputs that could be solved via
                boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning.  Without
                my contribution, all inputs had to be processed by a genetic
                algorithm which could solve any possible input, but was
                significantly slower.
              </p>

              <p>
                This project used Java and Eclipse. It involved
                both software engineering and computer language engineering,
                as I had input in the design of the constraint
                specification language.

              <p>
                I started the design for a data logger for the iPhone to track
                people's transportation methods. I also implemented a script to
                track usage of the <span class="acronym">mit</span> wi&ndash;fi
                network in various buildings on campus.  This script pulled
                information off of the
                <a href="https://mrtg.mit.edu/mrtg/">
                  MITnet Router Statistics website

                </a>
                related to the traffic from buildings of various types, and
                saved the data to a MySQL database.

              <h3>Intern at University of Maryland</h3>
              <p>
                I developed algorithms to analyze problems in
                classical cryptology under the mentorship of
                <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/">
                  Dr. William Gasarch
                </a>, a Computer Science professor at the
                University of Maryland. These algorithms attempted
                ciphertext&ndash;only attacks on texts enciphered through
                various means, including random polyalphabetic ciphers and
                polygraphic ciphers with large enciphering matrices.
                This project culminated in the development of a suite
                of programs that analyzed various ciphers and a presentation
                of my findings related to the feasibility of
                applying modern computing methods to classical ciphers.
