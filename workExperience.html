            </h3>
            <p>
              This was a 12-week internship in the New York office, on the 
              Docs Engineering Productivity team. I was working on 
              JsTestDriver, a framework for running unit and
              integration tests on JavaScript applications. JsTestDriver
              is being used by the Docs and Analytics teams, among others.
              It's also being used outside of Google.
            </p>

            <p>
              I added functionality to allow clients to
              embed the test runner in the browser along with the
              system under test. The existing method instead started a 
              separate server, and ran the test runner on the
              server. I designed and implemented a menu user
              interface, and reworked the test runner so it could be
              compiled by the Google Closure Compiler along with the
              rest of the system under test.
            </p>

            <p>
              My contributions to JsTestDriver allowed it to provide an 
              alternative workflow with a faster feedback loop in scenarios 
              where cross-browser compatibility does not need to be verified.
              (e.g. calls to libraries like jQuery which handle browser
              differences internally)

            <p>
              IsisWorld is an open-source 3D simulator designed
              for research in commonsense AI systems. It puts actors into a 
              kitchen environment, where they are given the goal of 
              accomplishing tasks like making toast. The challenge is in 
              training them to perform these tasks without
              overspecializationoverspecialization or scripting. My job 
              involved fine-tuning the simulation environment and the 
              scenarios, and giving the system a layer of polish before 
              we advertise it more.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also developed a related tool that allows
              users to tweak and optimize 3D models in the .egg file
              format (used by the Panda3D library). This is being used to 
              prepare models for IsisWorld, but it also has utility for 
              other projects that use 3D graphics with .egg files.
            </p>

              I developed a constraint evaluation algorithm as part of a
              project related to Infosys's ftGEN software which
              automatically generates test data for software systems.
              It reads a predicate defined in a constraint-specification 
              language and decides how to satisfy it. My
              code sped up the software by more than an order of
              magnitude for a class of inputs that could be
              solved via boundary value analysis and equivalence
              partitioning.  Without my contribution, all inputs
              had to be processed by a genetic algorithm which could solve
              any possible input, but was significantly slower.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project used Java and Eclipse. It involved
              both software engineering and computer language engineering,
              as I had input in the design of the constraint
              specification language.

              I started the design for a data logger for the iPhone to track

              I developed algorithms to analyze problems in
              classical cryptology under the mentorship of
              <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/">
                Dr. William Gasarch
              </a>, a professor of Computer Science at the
              University of Maryland. These algorithms attempted
              known-ciphertext attacks on texts enciphered through
              various means, including random polyalphabetic ciphers and
              polygraphic ciphers with large enciphering matrices.
              This project culminated in the development of a suite
              of programs that analyzed various ciphers and a presentation
              of my findings related to the feasibility of
              applying modern computing methods to classical ciphers.
